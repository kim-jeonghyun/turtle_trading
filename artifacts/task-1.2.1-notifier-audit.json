  "conclusion": "check_positions.py uses Telegram only. Discord and Email channels that existed in signal_check.py were not carried over to the unified script. daily_report.py still has all three channels configured.",
  "risk_assessment": "LOW - If users relied on Discord/Email notifications from signal_check.py, those notifications will stop. However, check_positions.py was already the active script and only used Telegram. Users who need Discord/Email can add channels to check_positions.py in a future release.",
